# Video to Soundscape Convertor

Vision is one of the most important features we have in our arsenal of sensory stimulations to experience life as we know it. As the world makes technological advances, we find ourselves surrounded by more and more screens and what's on them. The thought of losing our eyesight evokes a certain sense of fear as being in darkness not only hinders most of our daily activities but also holds us back from moving forward with society.
A significant portion of the human population is deprived of eyesight. Globally the number of people of all ages visually impaired is estimated to be 285 million, of whom 39 million are blind. Contrary to expectations, the visually impaired community has found ways to overcome their fears and (re)gain the ability to navigate by themselves. Their new found independence came from the ability to echolocate. Studies have shown that the brains of individuals who can echolocate have essentially rewired themselves such that audio cues activate regions of the visual cortex. In other words they can “see” with sounds.
The aim of our project is to utilize known technologies such as vOICe and deep learning to convert videos into audio files that can be understood by trained users. We use a deep learning method to obtain the depth maps, modify and filter the depth maps according to given settings to make new images and pass them as input through vOICe.
