Multiple lines won't work cuz reasons
so timbre doesn't really have to be messed with

Consider yoloX for object detection if its better

Details of midas transforms in here: https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS/blob/master/run.py

For me to do:

Range filtering
    - Use the output of this while filtering objects.
    - Slider mechanism not too shabby ig.

Generate audio for an image. Make a function for this that can be used later in video.
    - use prime numbered frequencies to avoid harmonics or timbre 
    - https://zach.se/generate-audio-with-python/
stuff. learn about that.

Make workflow for video
    - everything 60th (fps-th) frame so audio has same length as video
    - dmap, range filtering, object detec, filter objects on range filtered dmap
    - generate audio for each output

Outputs can be generated on youtube vids of stage plays to show relevance of range filtering.

2 points about performance:
    - dmap can be retrieved from audio using fourier analysis to show not much information is lost
    - show output of same image with different lighting, then do some similarity
        -> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3172911/compare-two-audio-files
        -> voice output: day vs night similarity will be low
        -> our output: day vs night will be high

Correlation possibilities
    - Pearson coefficient - https://www.researchgate.net/post/How-to-compare-shape-similarity-of-two-curves
    - some stuff here - https://www.researchgate.net/post/How_can_I_compare_the_shape_of_two_curves
        - 7th answer looks kinda nice ngl
    - cosine similarity of every column
    - some way to find signature or shape of signal
